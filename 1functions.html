      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <P>In mathematics, a functions is defined as an equation that defines the relationship between an independant variable, and a dependent variable.</P>
      <h2>One-to-One Functions</h2>
      <p>One-to-one functions are those that have a corresponding y variable for every x variable. Every corresponding value has exactly one solution.</p>

      <h2>Linear Systems</h2>
      <p>Linear systems are functions that were expanded to have three variables: the independant, the dependent, and the control. In a linear system, all three are linear. In order to solve for a variable, substitue 0 for the other variable and solve both equations. Repeat until the equation is solved.</p>

      <h2>Evaluating Functions</h2>
      <p>Evaluating functions is very simple: you are given an interger to represent the variable of a function, substitute the variable for the interger, then solve algebraically.</p>

      <h2>Domain and Range</h2>
      <p>The domain of a function, often represented by x, is the set of intergers that can be ran through the function. The domain is the set of resulting intergers from the domain.</p>

      <h2>Function Composition</h2>
      <p>Function composition is an operation that takes two functions, multiplies them, and produces a new variable from the resulting range.</p>

      <h2>Interval Notation</h2>
      <p>Interval notation is a way to describe continuous sets of real numbers by the numbers that bound them. Intervals, when written, look somewhat like ordered pairs. However, they are not meant to denote a specific point. Rather, they are meant to be a shorthand way to write an inequality or system of inequalities.</p>

      <h2>Inverse Functions</h2>
      <p>The function interval is said to be positive if the value of the function f (x) increases with an increase in the value of x. In contrast, the function interval is said to be negative if the value of the function f (x) decreases with the increase in the value of x.</p>
